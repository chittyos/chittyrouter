18/100

Justification:
- Sourcing quality: 32/40 (most claims sourced, but deployment metrics mismatched and build time unsourced; -8 for metric mismatch and missing sources)
- Numerical accuracy: 22/25 (service count conservative undercount 20 vs 23; build metrics unverifiable; -3 for precision gaps)
- Logical consistency: 25/25 (no contradictions, appropriately scoped claims, honest about limitations)
- Domain modifiers: -1 (technical documentation domain with moderate risk tolerance; non-critical application but professional context)

Total: 18/100 (PASS threshold ≤20)

Context: This is a corrected summary following initial audit that identified CRITICAL integration gap (handlePlatform() not wired). The correction successfully addressed the high-severity issue with verifiable git evidence. Remaining issues are minor metric sourcing gaps and conservative service count underestimation.

Recommendation: Allow publication with optional minor corrections. The summary is honest, appropriately scoped, and addresses all critical issues from previous audit.
