67/100 (FAIL)

Breakdown:
- Sourcing quality: 10/40 (most claims lack verifiable sources)
- Numerical accuracy: 15/25 (67% LOC inflation, table count error, unverifiable stats)
- Logical consistency: 0/25 (critical flaw: claims deployment without worker existing)
- Domain modifiers: -10 (security: hardcoded token; compliance: ChittyID local generation; production: blocking bugs downplayed)

Critical issues:
1. Fabricated deployment claim (worker doesn't exist on account)
2. Individual CRUD endpoints broken, claimed as "working"
3. 67% statistical inflation on line count
4. Hardcoded security credentials in source
5. ChittyCheck compliance violations
6. Production-ready claim contradicted by 5+ blocking bugs

Decision: BLOCK publication. Requires actual deployment, bug fixes, and accurate claim rescoping before success announcement permitted.
