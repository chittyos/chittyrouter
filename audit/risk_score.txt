38/100

BREAKDOWN:
- Sourcing quality (40% weight): 25/40
  - Primary sources present for deployment status (wrangler logs)
  - Test results logged in CSV
  - Source code diffs verify deployment gap
  - Missing: Worker tail logs for "forwarding disabled" claim
  - Missing: Cloudflare dashboard screenshots
  - Deduction: -15 for missing verification artifacts

- Numerical accuracy (25% weight): 10/25
  - Critical error: "100% accuracy" with n=1 sample (-10)
  - Performance claim "~1520ms" single data point (-3)
  - "25 minutes" estimate lacks methodology (-2)
  - Deduction: -15 for statistical misuse

- Logical consistency (25% weight): 18/25
  - Major contradiction: "Forwarding enabled" vs "Test mode" vs deployed code (-5)
  - Timeline confusion: Oct 3 vs Oct 4 deployment dates (-2)
  - Scope drift: "comprehensive" without evidence
  - Deduction: -7 for internal contradictions

- Domain modifiers (10% weight): 5/10
  - Legal case context increases evidence requirements
  - Production readiness claims require higher bar
  - Email routing is not health/finance domain (no strict mode)
  - Deduction: -5 for elevated standards

RISK ASSESSMENT:
Score of 38 falls in CAUTION range (21-40).

PASS threshold (≤20): Not met due to statistical errors and deployment status misrepresentation.

RECOMMENDATION: Require fixes to critical and high-priority issues before publication. Specifically:
1. Fix deployment status contradiction (CRITICAL)
2. Remove "100% accuracy" claim or add n=1 caveat (HIGH)
3. Clarify "comprehensive testing" as mostly manual (HIGH)
4. Add sample size requirements for performance baseline (MEDIUM)

After fixes, re-audit should achieve score ≤20 (PASS range).
