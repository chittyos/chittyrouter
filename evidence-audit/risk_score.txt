42/100

Moderate inflation - code is real and well-designed (1,292 lines), commits verified, AI integration functional, but operational readiness claims are overstated. Missing production infrastructure (bindings, tests, deployment), incorrect vector search implementation, and no automated reindexing despite claims. System is 60% complete prototype, not operational pipeline.
